# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the apm-server installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the

#================================= Logging =================================

# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, and stderr.
# Windows systems default to file output. All other systems default to syslog.

# Sets the minimum log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, or debug.

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, apm-server periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for

  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
  # reported by the local system clock. All other intervals are calculated from the
  # Unix epoch. Defaults to disabled.
  #interval: 0

#=============================== HTTP Endpoint ===============================

# apm-server can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats. For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.

# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Most settings from the Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that these settings should be configured to point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
